Gaining a level doesn't feel at all, thats why:
- Artifact gives you an item on level up
- TODO need to give a drawback to not to break a balance
  - 1. Maybe you need to destroy one of your items and get another one at random
  - 2. Maybe like (1), but tier is upgraded on destroy. Maybe its 2->1 items ratio
